# CS-1
All the projects I did in CS 1
My Magic 8 Ball code allows the user to enter a question, and a randomly generated response in a randomly generated color will appear, like a real Magic 8 Ball.
My Morning Routine code allows the user to answer questions about how they would go through their morning routine.
My Number Game code randomly generates a number from 1-10, and the user must guess the number. The user will earn points if they guess correct.
My Rock Paper Scissors code allows the user to participate in Rock Paper Scissors. In my code, the user can decide to play multiplayer or against the computer and is offered to use an extra weapon in the game.
My Initials Code, which can only be used in VR Blocks, displays my initials for the user.
My Maze Code, which can only be used in VR Blocks, allows the bot to maneuver to the end of any randomly generated maze.
My Food-O-Matic code randomly generates meals for the user, and the user gets to ask how many meals they want generated.
My Function Mashup code provides the user with the option to select a function of their choice, and the functions serve a variety of purposes.
My Password Keeper code stores and returns all the usernames and passwords for corresponding websites that the user enters. The user can also ask the computer to generate new, secure passwords. 
My Ties in a Game, Workaholic, and Machine Learning codes are all from a CS competition I participated in with other students. These programs are responses to prompts that were provided to us at the competition.
