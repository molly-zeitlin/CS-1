# CS-1
All the projects I did in CS 1
My Magic 8 Ball code allows the user to enter a question, and a randomly generated response in a randomly generated color will appear, like a real Magic 8 Ball.
My Morning Routine code allows the user to answer questions about how they would go through their morning routine.
My Number Game code randomly generates a number from 1-10, and the user must guess the number. The user will earn points if they guess correct.
My Rock Paper Scissors code allows the user to pariticpate in Rock Paper Scissors. In my code, the user can decide to play multiplayer or against the computer and is offereed to use an extra weapon in the game.
My Initials Code, which can only be used in VR Blocks, displays my initials for the user.
My Maze Code, which can only be used in VR Blocks, allows the bot to maneuver to the end of any randomly generated maze.
